# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dharmit, my pronouns are he/him.

A little bit about myself:
* Masters degree in Computer Science from Boston University
* Currently working as a Software Engineer at Red Hat.

I am proficient and have experience in:

* Languages such as Python, SQL, R, Java, and Bash Scripting
* Automation and test methodologies, particularly with using the Selenium and Cucumber testing frameworks
* Using tools such as Jenkins and Bamboo to build a robust CI/CD infrastructure.
* Cloud computing platforms such as AWS and OpenStack.
* Data Analytics and Visualization
* Databases
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

I'm passionate about writing code to automate tasks. 

I'm an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, providing machines with the ability to learn, think and perform tasks accordingly is something that intrigues and interests me greatly. I'm looking to learn more and work in this domain.
