# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dharmit, my pronouns are he/him.

A little bit about myself:
* Masters degree in Computer Science from Boston University
* Currently working as a Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat.

I am proficient and have experience in:

* Languages such as Python, SQL, R, Java, and Bash Scripting
* Automation and test methodologies, particularly with using the Selenium and Cucumber testing frameworks
* Using tools such as Jenkins and Bamboo to build a robust CI/CD infrastructure.
* Cloud computing platforms such as AWS and OpenStack.
* Data Analytics and Visualization
* Databases
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

In my current role, I work on building an orchestration infrastructure using Ansible to test interoperability between a suite of products at Red Hat. I also write code in Groovy to build and maintain efficient CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins that are used to run this infrastructure, and in Python to build software
applications/tools used as part of these CI workflows.

I'm passionate about writing code to automate tasks. 

I'm an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, providing machines with the ability to learn, think and perform tasks accordingly is something that intrigues and interests me greatly. I'm looking to learn more and work in this domain.
